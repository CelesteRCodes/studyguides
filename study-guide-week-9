
Recursion

    Recursion occurs when a function calls itself
    Any loop can be written instead with recursion; any recursion can be written instead with a loop
    Recursion is often useful in graph and tree problems

Graphs

    Graphs are like trees, except they can contain loops (“cycles”), and can be non-directed
    Nodes (or vertices) are connected by edges (or arcs).
    Graphs are useful for (among other things) tracking connections for a set of data, describing dependencies, and finding efficient ways to get from one state to another.

CompSci Data Structures

    Python lists allocate contiguous space for items
        Lists pre-allocate extra space to grow

    Python dictionaries and sets are hashed
        hash: stable “one-way” conversion of data to fixed-size result

    Linked lists and doubly-linked lists are good for queues
        Lists, linked lists, and doubly-linked lists are good for stacks, but there’s a trick to using a linked-list

Sorting

    Sorting is a commonly needed method

    Factors when choosing sorting algorithms:
        Runtime
        Space Requirements
    
    Likely Structure of your data:
        Random?
        Almost reversed?
        Almost sorted?
        Likely duplicates?

Practice Part 1: Discussion Questions

Make a new file and add your answers to the questions below. Push the file to your github repository along with the other solutions.
Recursion

    In your own words, what is recursion?

    Why is it necessary to have a base case?

Graphs

    What is a graph?

    Give an example of something that would be good to model with a graph.

Performance of Different Data Structures

Fill in the missing spots in the chart with the correct runtimes. Do this by reasoning through how the data structures work, NOT by looking up the solution. Add-R means add to the right/end/top and Add-L means add to the left/beginning/bottom. There are X’s in the spots where that operation doesn’t make sense for that data structure (for instance, you can’t index a stack, or pop from the end of a queue). We’ve provided the first few answers for you.

    Fill in the runtimes for the following actions for the table below:
